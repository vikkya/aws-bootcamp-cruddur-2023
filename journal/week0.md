# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

created zero budget for my IAM user

installed aws cli v2 in gitpod
below are the instruction I followed to do
1. open terminal (don't do in current directory. cd out from repo and then copy, unzip,and installls)
2. curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
3. unzip awscliv2.zip
4. sudo ./aws/install
5. run all the cmds one by one.
6. check `aws --version`

I had to run sudo aws/install next day as aws cmd was not found

we created a budget of $1 from cli.
1. first goto cli reference document
2. search for budget and goto examples
3. copy the budgets.json and notification-with-subscribers.json into aws/json directory
4. run the below cmd
`aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id $ACCOUNT_ID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/notifications-with-subscribers.json`
5. $ACCOUNT_ID is env variable in linux - I saved it by `export ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)` cmd

Then create a sns topic using cli
1. `aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm`
2. above cmd will output an arn `arn:aws:sns:ap-south-1:339713035107:billing-alarm`
3. after that create sns subscribe
4. `aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:ap-south-1:339713035107:billing-alarm \
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint ytubeindia2@gmail.com`

cloud watch alarm
1. `aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarms-config.json`
2. in alarms-config.json file change the arn to sns arn we created above
